                                                                                                 SALES ANALYTICS FOR BUSINESS ANALYSIS 
**Sales Analytics Report using SQL Database**

**Overview:**
This project involves creating a sales analytics report using data from a SQL database. The aim is to analyze sales performance and provide insights through a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard will visualize key metrics such as sales revenue, top-selling products, customer segmentation, and sales trends over time.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Extraction:** Connect to the SQL database and extract relevant sales data including order details, product information, and customer demographics.
   
2. **Data Transformation:** Perform necessary data cleaning and transformation steps in SQL to prepare the dataset for analysis. This may involve joining tables, aggregating data, and handling missing values.
   
3. **SQL Queries:** Write SQL queries to calculate metrics such as total sales revenue, top-selling products, customer segmentation based on demographics or purchase behavior, and sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
   
4. **Power BI Dashboard Creation:** Utilize Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes the insights derived from the SQL data. Design various visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps to represent different aspects of the sales data.
   
5. **Dashboard Components:**
   - **Sales Overview:** Display total revenue, average order value, and total number of orders.
   - **Top Selling Products:** Show the top N products by sales revenue or quantity sold.
   - **Customer Segmentation:** Analyze customer segments based on demographics (age, gender, location) or purchase behavior (frequency, recency, monetary value).
   - **Sales Trends:** Visualize sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns or growth opportunities.
   
6.  Add interactive features such as filters, slicers, and drill-down options to enable users to explore the data dynamically.
   
7. **GitHub Readme File:** Document the project on GitHub by providing a detailed readme file. Include a description of the project, instructions for setting up the SQL database connection, steps to import the Power BI dashboard, and screenshots of the dashboard visualizations.
8. 
By leveraging SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, this project aims to deliver actionable insights into sales performance. The interactive dashboard provides stakeholders with a user-friendly interface to explore and understand the sales data, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
